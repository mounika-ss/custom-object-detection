# Custom Object Detection using YOLOv5 & Roboflow

This project was developed as part of my AI internship at **Mistify AI Technologies**.  
The goal was to build a custom object detection model using YOLOv5 and Roboflow with a focus on training accuracy, dataset preparation, and deployment readiness.

## Features
- Used Roboflow for dataset annotation and preprocessing
- YOLOv5 model training and evaluation
- Model performance analysis with confidence thresholds and bounding boxes
